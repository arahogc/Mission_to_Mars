# Mission_to_Mars

## Purpose 

The purpose of this excercise is to scrape data from a NASA website, specifically centered around Mars information. 
The app.py allows you to load the webserver why the scraping.py scrapes all the data relevant to data wanted. 
The Missions_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb is where the scraping.py was first written and tested to make sure it worked. 
The ignore folder is all the other code used to practice but wasn't able to figure out how to use the command line to add that folder to the git.ignore file.
